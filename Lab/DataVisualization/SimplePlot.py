# to read from excel files, SQL databases etc and write to the same

# Once read, the data is mantained as a dataframe

#The dataframe can be manipulated in many ways:
# The following line retrieves data from the 'Date' column from first to the
# last row and prints it to std out

# Column manipulations - 
# set the date column to datetime and print to std out

#set the index to the date column

# Row manipulations - 
# group rows by by year using the 'resample' method and sum/year
# Resample is a convenience method that groups a time series by 
# periodicity of your choice - Ex. Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days etc
# In this case, the argument 'A' groups the periods by year
